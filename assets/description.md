## Developers

Proxima is an open-source Astro application that renders Swell’s flavor of Liquid templates (LiquidX). You can build themes for it to offer different designs and frontend functionality, or duplicate the app and use it as a starter for a custom storefront. Note that for hosting on Swell, the app must use only Cloudflare Workers runtime APIs.
